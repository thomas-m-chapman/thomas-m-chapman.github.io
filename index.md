### Technical Writer | Knowledge Management Strategist | Team Leader

Welcome to my portfolio. I’m currently exploring new opportunities in Technical Writing and Knowledge Management. If you’re looking for someone who blends strategic thinking with execution—let’s connect. I’m passionate about delivering content that helps people get things done.

I’m a strategic content leader and technical writer with 25+ years of experience driving documentation and knowledge programs across Engineering, IT, Product, and Support teams. My career spans individual contributor roles and leadership positions. I’m energized by both hands-on writing and guiding teams toward meaningful outcomes.

Whether building scalable content ecosystems, optimizing knowledge bases, or coaching/mentoring writers, I bring a deep understanding of content strategy, structured authoring, and cross-functional collaboration. I’ve led teams, served as product owner for enterprise KM platforms, and delivered measurable improvements in content quality, publishing efficiency, and user satisfaction.
